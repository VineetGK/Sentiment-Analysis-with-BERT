Sentiment Analysis with BERT Transformers
Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform Sentiment Analysis using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. Sentiment analysis is a key task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that helps classify textual data into sentiment categories like positive or negative. In this project, we use Hugging Face's transformers library and a pre-trained bert-base-uncased model to classify text sentiment.

Features
Data Loading and Preprocessing: Handles text tokenization, padding, and truncation using BERT's tokenizer.

Model Training: Fine-tunes the pre-trained BERT model on a sentiment dataset.

Evaluation: Measures accuracy and generates a classification report for model performance.

Scalability: Supports large datasets by using DataLoader for efficient batch processing.

Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7 or higher

PyTorch

Transformers library by Hugging Face

Scikit-learn

Pandas

Install the required libraries using:

pip install torch transformers scikit-learn pandas
Dataset
This project uses a toy dataset for demonstration purposes. Replace it with a real-world dataset like:

IMDb Reviews Dataset

Amazon Reviews Dataset

Each dataset should have:

Text: The content to classify.

Label: Sentiment labels (e.g., 0 for negative, 1 for positive).

How It Works
1. Data Preprocessing
Tokenizes text using the BertTokenizer from Hugging Face.

Converts text into input IDs and attention masks.

Encodes labels into tensors for training.

2. Model Training
Fine-tunes the pre-trained bert-base-uncased model.

Optimizes the model using the AdamW optimizer.

Trains over multiple epochs, displaying loss per batch.

3. Model Evaluation
Predicts sentiments on the validation set.

Measures accuracy and generates a classification report (precision, recall, F1-score).

Key Files
main.py: Contains the complete implementation of the project.

requirements.txt: Lists all dependencies required to run the project.

README.md: Documentation for the project.

Example Usage
Run the script:

python main.py
Expected Output:

Training loss for each epoch.

Final accuracy on the validation dataset.

Classification report with precision, recall, and F1-score.

Results
On the provided dataset, the model achieves:

Accuracy: Example ~85%

Improvement Areas: Can further improve with hyperparameter tuning or additional training data.

Future Enhancements
Deployment: Deploy the model using Flask, FastAPI, or AWS SageMaker.

Advanced Models: Experiment with models like RoBERTa, DistilBERT, or XLNet for better performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize learning rate, batch size, and other hyperparameters.

Visualization: Add interactive dashboards using tools like Plotly or Streamlit.
